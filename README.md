# Verilog-Projects
Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to design and model digital circuits at behavioral, RTL, and gate levels. It enables simulation, testing, and synthesis of hardware like ALUs, processors, and controllers. Widely used in VLSI and FPGA design, Verilog bridges coding and actual hardware implementation.
